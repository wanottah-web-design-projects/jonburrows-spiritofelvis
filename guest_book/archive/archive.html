										Last night after a meal with friends in Downham Market we walked past the 
										live sound of Elvis coming from The Swan Hotel down the road. Being fans of 
										Elvis we wandered on in to check it out and spent the next couple of hours 
										there having the most amazing time! Jon Burrows WAS Elvis! We couldn't believe 
										how good he is! THE BEST Elvis tribute- it was like having a private audience 
										with the King himself! The amazing voice, the looks, the mannerisms, the sense 
										of humour, the personality... Jon Burrows has the whole Elvis package. We can't 
										recommend him highly enough and will definately be seeing him again. Thanks for 
										a fantastic unexpected to our night out! :-) Jackie and Vaughan

									<p>Saturday May 18th 2013 (re: Wedding Anniversary, Swindon)</p>
									<p>
										Nick and I saw Jon at a friends wedding back in October 2011 and were keen to 
										book him for our wedding anniversary on May 18th 2013. We rang and were thrilled 
										that he agreed to travel to Swindon for our party. So last Saturday Jon was our 
										big surprise at our home in a marquee in the garden. To say Jon was fab is 
										a total understatement. He absolutley went down a storm. Our dance floor which was 16ft 
										by 12ft was jammed packed for most of the performance and at one point he was kind of lost 
										within the crowd at the back of the floor. Everybody agreed that he was totally fantastic, 
										he made our party 'the party of the year' according to one of our guests. Jon is the nicest 
										person you could meet and we would recommend anybody to book 'the spirit of Elvis'. 
										Worth every penny and something that we will all talk about for many years to come.

									<p>Saturday 11th May 2013 (re:The Beehive, Winchmore Hill)</p>
									<p>
										My close friends, wife and myself booked a table at the Beehive Enfield Saturday night 11th May 2013.</p>
									<p>
										I must start by saying this was the most amazing night. ELVIS TRIBUTE NIGHT. I have not seen 
										the pub so busy for years. If have to be totally honest I was waiting to see a funny Elvis 
										freaky performer. Well when the introduction started I thought here we go what would he 
										look like would he be over dressed and have an oversized wig well the first song began I 
										couldn't see the singer as the stage area was full, as I listened I said as I laughed I 
										don't like Mimers. I stood up on the chair I look through the crowd, I had to take a second 
										look it was as if i was listening to an old single from the jukebox. I have never seen or 
										heard such an amazing person do Elvis it was like Elvis was with us. I wish Jon every success. 
										The Spirit and soul of Elvis in one package thank you so so much.

										From the moment you appeared, as a surprise gift for the 80 year old Birthday Girl, the

										It was just amazing.
									</p>
									<p>
										As well as a supreme performance, it was the extras that made the night so special. You took 
										great care to make sure it was a surprise, you made Jessie feel like a million dollars she
